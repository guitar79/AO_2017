    "# Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Now before getting into scientific data analysis, we need **preprocessing**. In IRAF, this was done mainly using `IMCOMBINE` and `IMARITH`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can do it using an [Astropy Affiliated package `ccdproc`](http://ccdproc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), or you can make your own module. The name of the package `ccdproc` roots in the package `CCDPROC` of IRAF. `ccdproc` of astropy is basically aimed to deal with all (and even more) tasks that can be done using `CCDPROC` in IRAF.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we cannot believe all the packages to work correctly all the time, even this `ccdproc`, I generally recommend to make your own package if you want to do advanced works and rely on as small number of packages as possible (e.g., only numpy, scipy, and astropy core packages).\n",
    "\n",
    "I will demonstrate preprocessing using `spyder` IDE and `ccdproc` package. I also will not use `subprocess` or `os` modules of Python, because \"interactive\" manipulation will be more familiar to people who are used to IRAF. If you are familiar with such modules and want to make one single program which does all the preprocessing at once automatically, you can go ahead! I should encourage such trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The packages or modules used in this tutorial are\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ccdproc.CCDData`: If you open fits file using \"`astropy.io.fits`\", it will contain header and data, i.e., in an HDUList format. Although this gives much freedom, what we need are only very general data from the HDU: data (pixel values) and unit (ADU). `CCDData` is a class of such thing used in `ccdproc`, and it automatically imports only such *core information* from fits files.\n",
    "* `ccdproc.combine`: Does similar job as `IMCOMBINE` of IRAF.\n",
    "* `ccdproc.ccd_process`: Mainly used when you want to do all preprocessing with one single function. \n",
    "\n",
    "`ccd_process` will be the most frequently used one. If you give image, dark, and bias frame as inputs, there is only one reason you put them: You want a reduced image with dark and bias subtraction! So actually there is no need to explicitly use bias, dark, and flat treating functions one by one. Once bias is specified for `ccd_process`, it will understand you want to subtract bias; once flat is provided, it will do flat fielding. \n",
