Then you can do [`DAOFIND`](http://stsdas.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/gethelp.cgi?daofind) or IRAF's own starfinder algorithm, which is not used widely.

They are defined in the [Stetson 1987](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987PASP...99..191S) paper for the first time. `sharpness` is a measure of \"how sharp the target is\", and is kind of \"peak value / sky value\", roughly speaking. `sround` and `ground` are roundness parameters: `sround` is to measure the roundness based on the symmetric property of the source, and `ground` is based on the marginalized Gaussian fit to the object."
